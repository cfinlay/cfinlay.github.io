Montreal has a strong group of optimization researchers working in machine learning. They meet every second Friday under the umbrella organization [MtlOPT](https://mtl-mlopt.github.io/), where researchers present current research they are working on. This was a talk I gave on a paper we had recently submitted on
[training neural ODEs with kinetic regularization]({{site.url}}/publications/TrainNeuralODE)
