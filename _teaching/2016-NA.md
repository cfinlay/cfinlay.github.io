Teaching assistant for third year course on numerical analysis. Topics included numerical solvers for ODEs and PDEs, root finding algorithms, and first- and second-order optimization algorithms. Among other duties, I taught a weekly lab introducing fundamentals of coding for students who had not coded before.
