Pre-pandemic, I was invited to be a visiting fellow at IPAM's spring 2020 long program on high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. Although my stay was cut short, I did give a virtual talk as part of the program's workshop on [PDEs and Inverse Problems in Machine Learning](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-ii-pde-and-inverse-problem-methods-in-machine-learning/?tab=schedule). This talk was based on our paper on [training neural ODEs with kinetic regularization]({{site.url}}/publications/TrainNeuralODE)
