I'm a Head of Research at [Deep Render](https://deeprender.ai/), working on AI-based video compression.
Previously I was a post-doc at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), in machine learning. My PhD was in applied math, where I was supervised by 
[Adam Oberman](https://www.adamoberman.net/).  My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, machine learning, and applied math.
